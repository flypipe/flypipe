# Prepare for deployment:
# - run verification to double check the code quality
# - calculate the new prospective version
# - calculate the new prospective changelog
# By calculating the version/changelog here instead of in the deployment job we can double check these artifacts to
# ensure they are looking fine prior to releasing.
